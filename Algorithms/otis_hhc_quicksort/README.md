## Implementing Parallel Quick Sort on Optical Transpose Interconnection System (OTIS) Hyper Hexa-Cell (OHHC) Interconnection Network

The code/simulation is developed using open source CodeBlocks version 13.12.

The project file OTIS.CBP can be edited using the CodeBlocks file -> open project menu.

The project run under linux environment, only int16 (unidentified by the linux compiler should be replace with int).

The project is organized into following components:
-The main file in the parent directory.
-The include directory.
-The src directory.

The project requires the pthread library to be defined in the lib path.
