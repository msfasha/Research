## Quicksort Algorithm

compare the performance of sequential sorting algorithms under four different modes of execution, the sequential processing mode, a conventional multi-threading implementation, multi-threading with OpenMP Library and finally parallel processing on a super computer [Iman1 Super Computer](http://www.iman1.jo/iman1/)

Quick Sort algorithm was selected to run the experiments performed by this effort and the algorithm was run using different arrays sizes and different number of processors. 

The results and findings were analyzed uncovering limitations as well as enhancement potentials of sequential sorting algorithms using parallelism.
